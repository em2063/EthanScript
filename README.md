# EthaScript - A Programming Language Inspired by Crafting Interpreters

EthaScript is a programming language I'm developing as a side project while learning from the book Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom. This project is an exploration of language design and implementation, covering concepts such as:

- Lexical analysis: Tokenizing source code into meaningful components.
- Parsing: Transforming tokens into a syntax tree.
- Runtime environment: Building an interpreter for executing code.
- Error handling: Implementing clear and user-friendly error messages.

The goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of programming languages and interpreters while creating a functional and extensible language from scratch. It serves as a learning journey and a foundation for potential future enhancements.
